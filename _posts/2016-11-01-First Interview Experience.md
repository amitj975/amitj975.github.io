Recently Microsoft visited our campus for IDC internship program and following is my interview experience.

## Online MCQ Round:
It consists of 15 MCQs on Cocubes.com. This was an easy round and consisted mainly of output questions of c++/Java. Apart from this, there were some questions on Virtual functions and Operating System.

## Online Coding Round:
Two coding problems in one hour,again on Cocobues.com

1. [Save all leaf nodes of a Binary tree in a Doubly Linked List by using Right node as Next node and Left Node as Previous Node.](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connect-leaves-doubly-linked-list/)

2. [Given an array,find the maximum j – i such that arr[j] > arr[i].](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-an-array-arr-find-the-maximum-j-i-such-that-arrj-arri/)

It took me around 40 minutes to write code for both the questions.

## Group Fly Round:
Since I was among the top 4 students till the second round, therefore I was directly selected for the Interviews. But yeah, according to my friends, this was a bit tough round. Only 3 students were shortlisted from the remaining students.

## Interview Round I:
Firstly, tell me about yourself and some discussion on projects.
Coding Question on pen & Paper: Convert a String to Integer considering every possible corner case.

## Interview Round II:
Shortest Round among all, one Coding Question on pen & paper:
Remove Alternate Duplicate characters from a char array (you have to do it in place). Like keeping only the odd occurences of each character.

Example:
Input: “you got beautiful eyes”    
Output: ”you gtbeaiful es”  
Allowed Time Complexity was O(n) and Space Complexity was O(1).It took me 10min to come up with an algo.The interviewer was satisfied with my algo and said “no need to write the code”.

Hint : Use two Pointer Method and Bool array of length 256.
